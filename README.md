# 🚦 Traffic Monitoring & Controlling System – YOLOv8n

A real-time **Traffic Monitoring & Controlling System** powered by **YOLOv8n model**, designed to monitor vehicle density and dynamically control traffic signals based on congestion levels.

Built to reduce traffic congestion, optimize signal timing, and improve urban traffic flow efficiency.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Live traffic feed is captured from camera.
2. YOLOv8n detects and classifies vehicles.
3. Vehicles are counted lane-wise.
4. Signal timing dynamically adjusts based on congestion level.
5. System prioritizes lanes with higher density.
